# Stop Asian Hate Incidents Map

## Introduction

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a disturbing increase in the number of Asian hate crime incidents. In response to these events, a significant movement has emerged to combat Asian hate. To contribute to this cause, we have developed a website aimed at raising awareness about the scale of the issue.

One of our project contributors, Bruce Chen, is a Chinese American, making this issue deeply personal for us. With this website, we intend to present a visual representation of incidents as they occur, utilizing a heat map that displays the locations of "Anti-Asian incidents" reported in various articles. Our goal is to provide information that is both helpful and impactful, shedding light on areas where Asian hate crimes are most prevalent. Through this awareness, we hope to contribute to putting an end to this pressing issue.

## Features

- **Incident Heatmap:** The website includes an interactive heatmap that dynamically showcases the prevalence of Anti-Asian incidents based on reported locations.
